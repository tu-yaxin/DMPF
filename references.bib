We want to achieve this goal starting from a block cipher (which requires a message space of size N = 2n, for some n). We look at a few solutions to this problem, focusing on the case when M= [0, k - 1]. We see ciphers with arbitrary domains as a worthwhile primitive in its own right, and as a potentially useful one for making higher-level protocols.",

abstract="Existing symmetric encryption algorithms target messages consisting of elementary binary blocks of at least 64 bits. Some applications need a block cipher which operates over smaller and possibly non-binary blocks, which can be viewed as a pseudo-random permutation of n elements. We present an algorithm for selecting such a random permutation of n elements and evaluating efficiently the permutation and its inverse over arbitrary inputs. We use an underlying deterministic RNG (random number generator). Each evaluation of the permutation uses O(logn) space and O((logn)3) RNG invocations. The selection process is ``perfect'': the permutation is uniformly selected among the n! possibilities.",
